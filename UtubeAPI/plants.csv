It has showy purple or sometimes pinkish flowers and the gray-green foliage remains attractive well into winter.",full sun,tolerates droughty soil,"Deadheading after first bloom may encourage plants to rebloom.  This is also a good time to shape plants.  But avoid pruning after late summer until new growth begins the following spring.  Cut back heavily (to about 6 inches) every 2 or 3 years to keep plants from getting straggly.Compared with other shrubs, lavender is not a long-lived plant, so it is best to replace old plants about every ten years.For low hedges there are many dwarf and semi-dwarf cultivars to choose from that respond well to trimming.
